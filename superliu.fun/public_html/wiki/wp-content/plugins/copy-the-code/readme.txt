=== Copy Anything to Clipboard: the #1 WordPress Copy to Clipboard plugin

Add a copy button anywhere and simply copy it into the clipboard (ðŸ“‹).

You can copy to clipboard: code snippets, special symbols, discount codes, or anything which you want.

By default, the copy button is added to the `<pre>` tag. You can easily change the `pre` tag selector with any other selector. You can read more [about selector](https://maheshwaghmare.com/doc/copy-anything-to-clipboard/#what-is-the-selector).

Just use the shortcode as:

<pre>
[copy content="100OFF"]
</pre>

Above shortcode display text "Copy" and on click it the text "100OFF" copied into the clipboard.

We can change the "Copy" text with any other text as <code>text="Click Me"</code>.

E.g. <code>[copy text="Click Me" content="100OFF"]</code>

Here we can see the text "Click Me" and on click on it the text "100OFF" copied to the clipboard.

We see the text "Copied" after clicking on the link which indicate user something is copied to clipboard.
